we use a special wrapper `Xt.eventDelay` that set the delay on which the resize gets triggered with `Xt.resizeDelay` and `Xt.scrollDelay`.\\n\\n```js\\naddEventListener('resize', e => {\\n  Xt.eventDelay(e, document.documentElement, () => {\\n    // logic\\n  })\\n})\\n\\naddEventListener('scroll', e => {\\n  Xt.eventDelay(e, document.documentElement, () => {\\n    // logic\\n  })\\n})\\n```\\n\\n<div class=\\\"table-scroll\\\">\\n\\n|                         | Syntax                                    | Default                       | Description                   |\\n| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |\\n| Option                  | `Xt.eventDelay(e, element, function, prefix = '', instant = false)`              |        | event delay wrapper                  |\\n| Option                  | `resizeDelay:Number|Boolean`              | `500`        | Milliseconds to trigger the resize event with `Xt.eventDelay`            |\\n| Option                  | `scrollDelay:Number|Boolean`              | `500`        | Milliseconds to trigger the resize event with `Xt.eventDelay`                 |\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n### Resize\\n\\nWhen the `e.type = 'resize'`, `Xt.eventDelay` also calls the function **only if the height of the window changes**, to fix browsers bugs call on resize events when scrolling, and to not trigger the resize event on mobile when the address bar hides on scroll.\\n\\nTo **force** it also on **window width change** use `e.detail.force`:\\n\\n```js\\ndispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('resize', { detail: { force: true } }))\\n```\\n\\nYou can also trigger the resize or scroll event with **custom delay**, for instant use `delay: 0`.\\n\\n```js\\ndispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('resize', { detail: {delay: 0 } }))\\n```\\n\\n### Container\\n\\nYou can trigger some components events only inside some **container node**, not possible normally for resize events, just use `e.detail.container`:\\n\\n```js\\nconst checkResize = document.querySelector('.my-element')\\nconst eventResize = function (e) {\\n  // triggering e.detail.container\\n  if (!e || !e.detail || !e.detail.container || e.detail.container.contains(checkResize)) {\\n    // logic\\n  }\\n}\\ndocument.querySelector.addEventListener(eventResize)\\n\\n// triggering e.detail.container\\ndispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('resize', { detail: { force: true, container: document.querySelector('.my-container') } }))\\n```\\n\";","export default \"@import

Installation\\n\\n```Shell\\nnpm install xtend-library --save\\n```\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nWe have some boilerplate setup projects to start a project:\\n\\n* [vanilla boilerplate](https://github.com/minimit/xtend-theme-vanilla)\\n\\n#### Webpack\\n\\nThis library is made to be used by [webpack](https://github.com/webpack). In essence you have to setup webpack's resolve to be able to import the scripts and styles from the `node_modules/xtend-library` or from your custom folder if present (`./dist/xtend-library` in this case).\\n\\n```jsx\\n  resolve: {\\n    alias: {\\n      // resolve xtend-library js and less\\n      'xtend-library': [\\n        path.resolve(__dirname, './dist/xtend-library'),\\n        path.resolve(__dirname, './node_modules/xtend-library'),\\n      ],\\n    },\\n  },\\n  module: {\\n    unsafeCache: false,\\n```\\n\\nWith this setup you can **fork** css and js files inside `./dist/xtend-library` and the webpack resolver will load files from it or fallback to `./node_modules/xtend-library`.\\n\\n**IMPORTANT** do not fork the files inside `./core/demos` they can change anytime\\n\\n#### Css\\n\\nYou need to import the **reset** file as first import:\\n\\n```less\\n@import 'xtend-library/src/xtend-reset.less'; // always first loaded\\n```\\n\\nThen you can import the **components you need** as described in the docs:\\n\\n```less\\n@import (reference) '/src/xtend-core.less'; // be sure to import the library as reference first\\n@import 'xtend-library/src/extensions/slider/slider.less';\\n```\\n\\nOr just import **all core** and **extensions** and **addons** needed (preferred method):\\n\\n```less\\n@import 'xtend-library/src/xtend-core.less';\\n@import 'xtend-library/src/extensions/slider/slider.less';\\n```\\n\\nTo modify a **less** or **js** file add [webpack resolve](/introduction/setup#usage-webpack) and fork the file copying it in your project.\\n\\n#### Js\\n\\nYou need to install [relaxed-json](https://www.npmjs.com/package/relaxed-json):\\n\\n```Shell\\nnpm install --save relaxed-json\\n```\\n\\nYou need to install and import [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js):\\n\\n```Shell\\nnpm install --save core-js@2 regenerator-runtime\\n```\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport 'core-js'\\nimport 'regenerator-runtime/runtime'\\n```\\n\\nYou need to import the **polyfills** files and the **main** js:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport '/src/polyfill.js'\\nimport { Xt } from '/src/xt.js'\\n```\\n\\nThen you can import the **components you need** as described in the docs:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport '/src/extensions/slider/slider.js'\\n```\\n\\nOr just import **all core** and **extensions** and **addons** needed (preferred method):\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport '/src/xtend-core.js'\\nimport '/src/extensions/slider/slider.js'\\n```\\n\\nTo modify a **less** or **js** file add [webpack resolve](/introduction/setup#usage-webpack) and fork the file copying it in your project.\\n\\n#### Gsap\\n\\nThis library in the demos uses [gsap](https://github.com/greensock/GSAP) and [bezier-easing](https://github.com/gre/bezier-easing) for javascript animations.\\n\\n```\\nnpm install --save gsap bezier-easing\\n```\\n\\n## Browser support\\n\\nSupported browsers are as follow: **explorer 12**, **firefox 38**, **opera 25**, **safari 10**, **chrome 38**.\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nWe use gatsby to serve the docs:\\n\\n* Install required npm packages with `npm install`\\n* Use `npm run build` to build the docs in `/public`\\n* Use `npm run dev` to serve a develop version\\n* Use `npm run serve`to serve a production version\\n\\n## Acknowledgements\\n\\n* Icons with [feather

\\\"Customizable sliders with custom animation and interaction.\\\"\\n---\\n\\n## Setup\\n\\nTo use this component import the **less** and **js** files accordingly:\\n\\n```less\\n@import 'xtend-library/src/extensions/slider/slider.less';\\n```\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport '/src/extensions/slider/slider.js'\\n```\\n\\nOr just import **extensions**:\\n\\n```less\\n@import 'xtend-library/src/xtend-extensions.less';\\n```\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport '/src/xtend-extensions.js'\\n```\\n\\n[[noteDefault]]\\n| To modify a **less** or **js** file add [webpack resolve](/introduction/setup#usage-webpack) and fork the file copying it in your project.\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nUse this markup to create a **slider**.\\n\\n<script type=\\\"text/plain\\\" class=\\\"language-markup\\\">\\n  <div class=\\\"slider\\\" data-xt-slider>\\n\\n    <div class=\\\"slides\\\">\\n      <ul class=\\\"slides-inner\\\">\\n\\n        <li class=\\\"slide\\\">\\n

the slider, so if you don't want to show it add `.display-none`.\\n\\n## Initialization\\n\\nInitialize automatically within markup with `[data-xt-slider=\\\"{ <options> }\\\"]` on the **object**:\\n\\n[[noteDefault]]\\n| **Object** is the DOM element you want to assign the component.\\n\\nOr initialize with javascript:\\n\\n```js\\nlet self = new Xt.Slider(document.querySelector('#my-object'), {\\n  // options\\n})\\n```\\n\\nOr inizialize with **mutation observer** (preferred method):\\n\\n```js\\nXt.mount.push({\\n  matches: '#my-object',\\n  mount: object => {\\n    // init\\n\\n    let self = new Xt.Slider(object, {\\n      // options\\n    })\\n\\n    // unmount\\n\\n    const unmount = () => {\\n      self.destroy()\\n      self = null\\n    }\\n    return unmount\\n  }\\n})\\n```\\n\";","export default \"import path from 'path'\\n\\nconst filename = __filename.replace(/\\\\\\\\/g, '/')\\nconst dirs =
