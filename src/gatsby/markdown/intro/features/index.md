Interactions and animations are not easy at all. Here's why **Xtend UI is not the usual frontend library**, it's designed to **make hard javascript task effortless**, that could take days or even months to implement and that needs various iterations and complex use case to do properly.

## Accessibility

A11y standards with **automatic Aria attributes and keyboard navigation**.

For more info on **accessibility practices** used in Xtend UI see [ARIA Design Pattern Examples](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/), [digitala11y](https://www.digitala11y.com/).

#### Toggle

Toggle components **have automatic a11y attributes and keyboard navigations**, and they can be customized granularly, see [drop accessibility](/components/drop/other#accessibility), [overlay accessibility](/components/overlay/other#accessibility), [slider accessibility](/components/slider/other#accessibility), [toggle accessibility](/components/toggle/other#accessibility), [tooltip accessibility](/components/tooltip/other#accessibility).

#### Prefers Reduced Motion

See [animation setup](/components/animation#setup) to **disable css and js animations** when the the user has activated "Prefers Reduced Motion".

## Global

#### Javascript

- Mount javascript code on **nodes when they are added to DOM** with **vanilla html and js** with [Xt.mount](/components/global/javascript#xt-mount).

- Animate nodes with **tailwindcss variants** with [Xt.on and Xt.off](/components/global/javascript#xt-on-and-xt-off).

- **Customizzable default options for all components of the same type** with [Xt.options](/components/global/javascript#xt-options).

## Toggle

Toggle components **share the same base code and features**, they are used for **all interactions that toggle a class and respond to it**, they are [drop](/components/drop), [overlay](/components/overlay), [slider](/components/slider), [toggle](/components/toggle), [tooltip](/components/tooltip).

#### Interaction

You can customize **toggle components interaction** in many ways, here's a simplified rundown of what's possible.

- You can **filter elements and targets dynamically**.

- You can **group elements and targets** to create **many to many interactions between elements and targets**.

- You can **specify min and max concurrent activations**.

- You can **set the javascript event that respond to the interaction**.

See [drop interaction](/components/drop/interaction), [overlay interaction](/components/overlay/interaction), [slider interaction](/components/slider/interaction), [toggle interaction](/components/toggle/interaction), [tooltip interaction](/components/tooltip/interaction) for more info.

#### Animation

You can animate all **toggle components** with **tailwindcss variants** or **css** or **js**, whatever you prefer or need to use. Toggle advanced animation system support also **delay**, **queue**, **collapse**.

See [drop animation](/components/drop/animation), [overlay animation](/components/overlay/animation), [slider animation](/components/slider/animation), [toggle animation](/components/toggle/animation), [tooltip animation](/components/tooltip/animation) for more info.

#### Hash

Sometimes you need to **save the state of a component in the location hash**, to be linkable and more usable. With all the **toggle components** you can link the activation in the url hash.

See [overlay hash](/components/overlay/interaction#hash), [slider hash](/components/slider/interaction#hash), [toggle hash](/components/toggle/interaction#hash) for more info.

#### Scrollto

Sometimes you need to **automatically scroll to the activated nodes**, you can use the [Scrollto component](/components/scrollto) in conjunction with any **toggle component**. It also integrates with the **toggle hash** interaction.

See [scrollto toggle](/components/scrollto#toggle-integration) for more info.

#### Addon

Many advanced usage of toggle components are in the addon pages.

- Slider notable addons are **navigation sides**, **status**. See [slider addon](/components/slider/addon) for more info.

- Tooltip notable addons are **swap**. See [tooltip addon](/components/tooltip/addon) for more info.

## Scroll

#### ScrollTrigger

Xtend UI uses gsap for javascript animations, not only that but it relies on [Gsap ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger) to do **all sort of interaction on page scroll**.

See [fade](/components/scrolltrigger/fade), [sticky](/components/scrolltrigger/sticky), [parallax](/components/scrolltrigger/parallax) for more info.

#### Scrollto

ScrollTo is a plugin that manages **interaction scroll**, by setting it up it automatically reacts to **hash links referring to ids on click and page load** or **can get triggered on any node**, with automatic activation on scroll.

See [scrollto](/components/scrollto) for more info.

#### Stickyflow

Stickyflow is a plugin that enhance **css sticky position** by making it **scroll the content also if overflowing the window**.

## Core

All core components are **primitive UI elements** that promotes creativity with its support for complex design.

#### Card

#### List and Row

The **list and row components** are useful to space any element with margins or paddings, they also spaces vertically. When you want to **space child element within flex** they provide simple spacing classes for browsers that still don't support [flex gap](https://caniuse.com/flexbox-gap). See [list](/components/list), [row](/components/row) for more info.

#### Media

The **media component** is useful to enhance html assets. It can be used with `img`, `video`, `iframe` tags to properly **fit to aspect ratio**, display a **skeleton loader** or just as a base standard markup for animating assets.
